* filetags

This fork of https://github.com/novoid/filetags adds the ablility to tag directories.

To treat directories as taggable objects, either:

1. Manually add tags to a dir (e.g., 'folder -- fantasy scifi')
2. Create the file '.filetags--tag-dirs' in the parent directory of the directories you want to be taggable.

Note that taggable directories are treated as files and will never be recursed into.
